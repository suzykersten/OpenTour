# OpenTour
An app that lets people tag locations and leave comments about any location in the world, from the history of the location to their own personal history with the place. Other people can come through and see the comments others have left, creating a map-based history of an area.

**NOTE:** The upload file button does NOT work.

## Current Iteration
Currently, OpenTour is a very basic version of our vision. You can see it live here: https://opentour.z19.web.core.windows.net/, where you can see points other people have placed and place your own points.

## Future Plans
[ ] Categorize points: History, Sports, Personal, Religious, any others people feel are necessary?
[ ] Allow for a person to create 'groups' of points, called a tour: Idea is a national park could plop down 50 points, put them in a 'tour' named something like "Dunbar Cave Short Trail", and users could choose that 'tour' and only see points related to that tour.
[ ] Fix the popup window so it appears over the point.
[ ] Implement some system to handle multiple points being placed at one location: Upvote system to keep good comments high? Sort by newest when showing points?
